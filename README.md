1. Rock Paper Scissors

The game starts by asking the player:
"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, and 2 for Scissors."

In this project, I learned how to:
- Store the user's input
- Generate a random choice for the computer
- Compare the user's and computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw)
- Give feedback to the player (even when they input an invalid choice)

2. Treasure Island

A "Choose Your Own Adventure" game. 

In this project, I learned how to:
- Use conditionals such as if, elif, and else statements to lay out the logic and the story's path
- Use multiple sets of quotes inside a string and "escape" them
- Incorporate ASCII art into my code
