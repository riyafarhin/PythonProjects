4. FizzBuzz Game

    Objectives:
    - Write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.
    - The rules of the FizzBuzz game are as follows:
        The program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn, including the number 100.
        When a number is divisible by 3, the program should print "Fizz" instead of the number.
        When a number is divisible by 5, the program should print "Buzz" instead of the number.
        If the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 (e.g., 15), the program should print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number.
