The game starts by asking the player:
"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper, and 2 for Scissors."

This project I learned how to:
- Store the user's input
- Generate a random choice for the computer
- Compare the user's and computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw)
- Give feedback to the player (even when they input an invalid choice)
